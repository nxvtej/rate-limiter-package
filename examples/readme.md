Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping Gateway

Project Overview
This project is a high-performance API Gateway built with Python's FastAPI. It acts as an intelligent front-door for your backend services, centralizing concerns like traffic management, security, and observability before requests reach your core applications.

It's designed to showcase key backend engineering principles:

Distributed Systems: How to maintain state (like rate limits) across multiple gateway instances using a shared data store (Redis).
Traffic Management: Implementing strategies to control and shape the flow of requests.
Proxying: Transparently forwarding requests and responses between clients and backend services.
Why build this?
As backend systems scale, protecting individual services from sudden traffic spikes, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or simply ensuring fair usage becomes critical. This gateway provides a robust solution to these challenges, making it a powerful component in any modern microservices architecture by:

Preventing Backend Overload: Protecting services from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
Ensuring Fair Usage: Limiting individual clients to prevent resource hogging.
Centralizing Concerns: Handling common tasks like rate limiting, logging, and potentially authentication at the edge, rather than replicating logic in every backend service.
Core Features Implemented (MVP)
This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on delivering core traffic management capabilities:

1. Distributed Rate Limiting (Fixed Window Counter)
   Concept: Prevents individual clients from overwhelming backend services by limiting their requests within a defined time window (e.g., 5 requests per 60 seconds).
   Distributed Aspect: Utilizes Redis as a shared, high-speed data store to ensure rate limits are enforced consistently across multiple instances of the gateway. This prevents clients from bypassing limits by hitting different gateway servers.
   Mechanism: Tracks requests by client IP address. On each request, it increments a counter in Redis for that IP and sets/resets a Time-To-Live (TTL) for the counter. If the limit is exceeded, the request is immediately blocked, and a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code is returned to the client, along with a Retry-After header.
2. Transparent Request Proxying
   Concept: The gateway receives an incoming HTTP/HTTPS request, processes it, and if allowed, forwards the exact request (preserving HTTP method, headers, query parameters, and body) to a configurable upstream backend service. It then transparently relays the backend's response back to the original client.
   Key Tech: Leverages httpx, an asynchronous HTTP client, for efficient and non-blocking request forwarding. It also correctly handles Host and X-Forwarded-For/X-Forwarded-Proto headers for proper backend routing and client IP preservation.
3. Basic Traffic Shaping (Concurrency Control)
   Concept: Protects the backend by limiting the total number of simultaneous (concurrent) requests the gateway will forward to the upstream service. This prevents the backend from being overwhelmed by a sudden surge in parallel requests, even if individual clients are within their rate limits.
   Mechanism: Uses Python's asyncio.Semaphore to manage the concurrent outgoing connections. If the semaphore is exhausted, the gateway will queue requests (or potentially reject them with a 503 Service Unavailable if a timeout is applied to semaphore acquisition) until a slot becomes available.
4. Basic Monitoring & Health Checks
   Metrics: Simple in-memory counters for total requests processed and total requests blocked provide quick operational insights into the gateway's activity.
   Health Endpoint: A dedicated /health endpoint exposes the gateway's operational status. It checks connectivity to Redis and the upstream backend service, making it crucial for deployment monitoring systems.
5. Configurable via Environment Variables
   All critical operational parameters (e.g., Redis URL, backend URL, rate limit values, concurrency limits) are easily configurable via environment variables (.env file or system environment variables). This makes deployment flexible and promotes best practices for twelve-factor apps.

Architectural Components Explained
Client: Represents any user or application making HTTP/HTTPS requests. All requests are routed through the Gateway.
Rate Limiting & Traffic Shaping Gateway (FastAPI):
The central component built with FastAPI. It intercepts and processes all incoming requests.
Internal Flow:
Incoming Request: Receives HTTP/HTTPS requests.
Client Identification: Determines the client's identity, typically by IP address.
Distributed Rate Limiting: Consults Redis to check/update rate limit counters. Blocks requests with 429 Too Many Requests if limits are exceeded.
Concurrency Control (Traffic Shaping): Manages the number of concurrent requests sent to the backend using an asyncio.Semaphore.
Request Proxying / Forwarding: Uses httpx to send allowed requests to the upstream backend.
Backend Response Handling: Forwards the backend's response back to the original client.
Upstream Backend Service(s):
The actual application services that contain business logic (e.g., microservices, database interactions).
For this project, a structured backend_app (also a FastAPI application) serves as the dummy backend.
Redis:
An external, in-memory data store. It serves as the shared state for distributed rate limiting counters, ensuring consistency across potentially multiple gateway instances.
Metrics & Logging:
Internal counters track overall request statistics.
Extensive logging provides visibility into request processing, rate limit hits, and errors.
The /health endpoint offers an external interface for monitoring the gateway's operational status and its dependencies.

Follow these steps to get the Rate Limiting and Traffic Shaping Gateway and its dummy backend up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.9+: Download Python (ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation).
pip: Python's package installer (comes with Python).
Redis Server:
Recommended (Docker Desktop): Install Docker Desktop.
Standalone: Follow official instructions for your OS to install Redis.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:
Bash

git clone [your-repository-url]
cd rate_limiter_gateway
Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment:
Bash

python -m venv venv

# On Windows Command Prompt:

venv\Scripts\activate

# On Windows PowerShell:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# On Linux/macOS:

source venv/bin/activate
Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with (venv).
Install Python Dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Ensure requirements.txt exists from your previous pip freeze > requirements.txt step. If not, create it by manually listing: fastapi uvicorn[standard] httpx redis python-dotenv).
Start the Redis Server:
Using Docker (Recommended):
Bash

docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
Standalone: Start your Redis server manually as per its installation.
Configure Environment Variables (Optional, but recommended):
Create a .env file in your rate_limiter_gateway directory.
Define the following variables (values are defaults, change if necessary):

# .env file content

REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
UPSTREAM_BACKEND_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8001"
RATE_LIMIT=5 # Max requests per window
TIME_WINDOW=60 # Window duration in seconds
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=20 # Max simultaneous requests gateway sends to backend
LOG_LEVEL=INFO # INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
Run the Dummy Backend Service:
Open a new terminal (and activate your virtual environment in it).
Navigate to your project directory and run:
Bash

uvicorn backend_app.main:app --port 8001 --reload
Verify it's running by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8001/ or http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs in your browser.
Run the Rate Limiting Gateway:
Open another new terminal (and activate your virtual environment).
Navigate to your project directory and run:
Bash

uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
Verify it's running by checking the console logs for "Successfully connected to Redis" and "Gateway started."
How to Test
Ensure both your backend_app (port 8001) and Gateway (main.py on port 8000) are running before testing.

1. Gateway Health Check
   Open your browser or use curl:
   Bash

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
Expected Output: A JSON response indicating status: OK, redis_status: Connected, backend_status: Connected, and current request counts. 2. Testing Proxying
Access various endpoints through the gateway. These requests should be seamlessly forwarded to the dummy backend.
Bash

# Access the backend's root

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# Get a specific user

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1

# List all products

curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/

# Create a new user (POST request)

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "David", "email": "david@example.com"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/
Expected Output: Responses from the dummy_backend service, showing successful forwarding. 3. Testing Rate Limiting
Rapidly send requests to any gateway endpoint to exceed the configured RATE_LIMIT.
Bash

# On Linux/WSL/Git Bash (adjust sleep for faster/slower bursts):

for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{url_effective}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8000/; sleep 0.1; done

# You can also use a web browser and repeatedly refresh the page (F5)

Expected Output:
The first few requests (up to RATE_LIMIT) will return 200 OK.
Subsequent requests from the same IP within the TIME_WINDOW will return 429 Too Many Requests.
Gateway terminal logs will show INFO messages for allowed requests and WARNING messages when a rate limit is exceeded.
The backend_app terminal logs should only show requests that were allowed by the gateway (no logs for 429s). 4. Testing Concurrency Control (Advanced)
To observe MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS in action, temporarily make your dummy_backend.py endpoints simulate a longer processing time (e.g., await asyncio.sleep(2)).
Then, use a load testing tool or a custom script to send a high number of concurrent requests to the gateway (e.g., more than MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS).
Expected Behavior: The gateway should queue or delay forwarding requests to ensure your backend doesn't receive more than MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS simultaneously. If requests time out due to semaphore contention or backend slowness, the gateway might return 504 Gateway Timeout or 503 Service Unavailable.
Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP)
This project lays a strong foundation for a robust API gateway. Here are several areas for future expansion:

Advanced Rate Limiting Algorithms:
Implement Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket algorithms for smoother traffic shaping and burst handling.
Support sliding log or sliding window counter for more precise rate limiting.
Dynamic Rule Management:
Create an administrative API endpoint to allow adding, updating, and deleting rate limiting rules (per IP, per API key, per endpoint) without restarting the gateway.
Store rules in a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for durability.
API Key / User-Based Rate Limiting:
Implement authentication (e.g., JWT validation) and apply rate limits based on authenticated API keys or user IDs, rather than just IP addresses.
Metrics and Observability:
Integrate with external monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana to expose detailed metrics (request counts, latency, error rates, blocked requests) for dashboards and alerts.
Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to track requests across the gateway and backend services.
Circuit Breaker Pattern:
Implement a circuit breaker to automatically "trip" (stop sending requests) to unhealthy backend services, preventing cascading failures and allowing services to recover.
Advanced Load Shedding:
Implement more sophisticated mechanisms to gracefully degrade service under extreme load, such as dropping lower-priority requests or returning cached responses.
Caching Layer:
Add an optional caching layer within the gateway to cache responses from the backend for frequently accessed endpoints, reducing backend load and improving latency.
Request/Response Transformation:
Ability to modify request headers, body, or response content on the fly (e.g., adding security headers, stripping sensitive information).
Middleware & Plugins:
Design a pluggable architecture to easily add new functionalities (e.g., logging middleware, authentication middleware).
TLS/SSL Termination:
Handle HTTPS requests, decrypting them at the gateway and forwarding plain HTTP to the backend (or re-encrypting).
Deployment Automation:
Provide a Dockerfile for easy containerization and deployment to Kubernetes or other container orchestration platforms.
Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
